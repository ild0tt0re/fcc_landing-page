### User Stories
| US | Description |
| :------------ | :----------- |
| **#1**: | My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header". |
| **#2**: | I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here. |
| **#3**: | Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar". |
| **#4**: | I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link. |
| **#5**: | When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page. |
| **#6**: | I can watch an embedded product video with id="video". |
| **#7**: | My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form". |
| **#8**: | Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address. |
| **#9**: | The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for. |
| **#10**: | The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address. |
| **#11**: | Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit". |
| **#12**: | When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit) that confirms the email address was entered and that it posted successfully. |
| **#13**: | The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport. |
